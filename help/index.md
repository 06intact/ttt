Need help with Solidity? Try these resources.

### [Ethereum Forum](https://forum.ethereum.org/categories/solidity)

The Ethereum forum contains questions and answers about Solidity and of course,
you can always ask a new question. Beware that some answers
might be outdated in the meantime as Solidity evolved quite a bit over time.

### [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)

Gitter is used by developers, contributors, experienced and new users alike to
discuss Solidity.

### [Ethereum Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum)

The Ethereum subreddit is also quite active, but not as focused on Solidity as
the other options.

### [Report Issues](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues)

If you think you might have found a bug, please file a new issue!
