Events allow the convenient usage of the EVM logging facilities,
which in turn can be used to "call" JavaScript callbacks in the user interface
of a dapp, which listen for these events.

Events are
inheritable members of contracts. When they are called, they cause the
arguments to be stored in the transaction's log - a special data structure
in the blockchain.

Up to three parameters can
receive the attribute `indexed` which will cause the respective arguments
to be searched for: It is possible to filter for specific values of
indexed arguments in the user interface.

If arrays (including `string` and `bytes`) are used as indexed arguments, the
sha3-hash of it is stored as topic instead.

The hash of the signature of the event is one of the topics except if you
declared the event with `anonymous` specifier. This means that it is
not possible to filter for specific anonymous events by name.

All non-indexed arguments will be stored in the data part of the log.

{% highlight javascript %}
contract ClientReceipt {
  event Deposit(
    address indexed _from,
    bytes32 indexed _id,
    uint _value
  );
  function deposit(bytes32 _id) {
    // Any call to this function (even deeply nested) can
    // be detected from the JavaScript API by filtering
    // for `Deposit` to be called.
    Deposit(msg.sender, _id, msg.value);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The use in the JavaScript API would be as follows:
{% highlight JavaScript %}
var abi = /* abi as generated by the compiler */;
var ClientReceipt = web3.eth.contract(abi);
var clientReceipt = ClientReceipt.at(0x123 /* address */);

var event = clientReceipt.Deposit();

// watch for changes
event.watch(function(error, result){
  // result will contain various information
  // including the argumets given to the Deposit
  // call.
  if (!error)
    console.log(result);
});

// Or pass a callback to start watching immediately
var event = clientReceipt.Deposit(function(error, result) {
  if (!error)
    console.log(result);
});

{% endhighlight %}
