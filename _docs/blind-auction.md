In this section, we will show how easy it is to create a
completely binding auction contract on Ethereum.
We will start with an open auction where everyone
can see the bids that are made and then extend this
contract into a blind auction where it is not
possible to see the actual bid until the bidding
period ends.

## Simple Open Auction

The general idea of the following simple auction contract
is that everyone can send their bids during
a bidding period. The bids already include sending
money / ether in order to bind the bidders to their
bid. If the highest bid is raised, the previously
highest bidder gets her money back.
After the end of the bidding period, the
contract has to be called manually for the
beneficiary to receive his money - contracts cannot
activate themselves.
