In Solidity, contracts are what classes are in object-oriented languages.
They can contain **state variables**, **functions**, **structs**, and **events**.

* State variables are values which are permanently stored in contract storage.
* Functions are are the executable units of code within a contract.
* Structs are custom defined types.
* Events are convenience interfaces with the EVM logging facilities.
