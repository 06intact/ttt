In Solidity, contracts are what classes are in object-oriented languages.
They can contain so-called state variables, which are permanently stored
in storage together with the contract and functions, the entry pointers
into operating on these state variables. Apart from state variables, there are
also local variables declared inside functions, whose content is cleared
as soon as control flow returns from the function.
